## EyetrackingR - README

### Introduction
Welcome to the bootstrapped cluster-based data analysis using the eyetrackingR package. The authors of this package provide an excellent vignette explaining the logic behind each step, which you can find here: http://www.eyetracking-r.com/vignettes/divergence. In this repository's scripts, I offer additional information on preprocessing and address common errors you may encounter during eyetracking data analysis. Ensure you have R and R Studio installed before running the scripts.

### Project Overview
In these scripts I analyze data from a forced-choice task where participants had to identify a picture corresponding to an auditory input. Only two pictures, a target and a distractor, were presented simultaneously. The manipulated variables included grammatical gender (congruent or incongruent between the target and the distractor) and animacy (pictures were either animate or inanimate objects)."

### Getting Started
To start using the eyetrackingR, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have R and R Studio installed.
3. Customize the scripts to specify the paths to your data and desired output directories.
4. Run the script or adapt it for your specific needs.

### Workflow:

1. Execute "preprocessing.R" to preprocess your data.
2. Execute "eyetrackingR" to analyse and visualize your eyetracking data.
